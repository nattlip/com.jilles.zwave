# someZwave



This app is made for the EZMotion + Zwave device of Express Controls also know as the Homeseer HMS100.

The app is called someZwave to make it possible to add other legacy or rare Zwave devices to Homey not current at the momemt 
but popular in the past when Zwave was founded. 

To fully understand the device settings , see http://www.expresscontrols.com/pdf/EZMotion+OwnerManual.pdf
yuu can use the poll interval only if the device is not battery powered 

there is an action flow card created for if temperature goes below a certain value.
